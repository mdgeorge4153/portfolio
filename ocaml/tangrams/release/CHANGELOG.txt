version 8: unreleased
 - fixed comment for contains in region.mli
 - added RingProperties to OrderedRingProperties

version 7: released 10/27:
 - region.ml bug fixes and more extensive testing
 - writeup typo: replaced Minkowski sum with Minkowski difference

version 6: released 10/21 2:00 AM
 - updated writeup question 7 to say OrderedRingProperties(Ints) instead of
   just RingProperties(Ints).  See Piazza post @866

 - completed Region.Make.union.  It seems to work; please report any bugs

version 5.1: released 10/21 2:35 PM
 - removed logging from released files, they were causing a type mismatch.

version 5: released 10/21
 - added TODOs to stubs for obstacles and selection functions
 - partial implementation of region.ml: everything but union is implemented and
   works
 - added "test_region.ml" as an example of my testing workflow.  See Piazza post
   @858
 - small change to writeup: in the description of the Minkowski difference, the
   writeup said

     "we compute a representation of the set of points $y$ such that if $S$ were
      placed at $y$, there would be no overlaps"

   it has been changed to

     "... there would be an overlap"


version 4: released 10/15
 - rolled back changes in version 3
 - removed redundant nums.cma from Makefile

version 3: released 10/14
 - changed FieldOfFractionsType to a module type rather than a functor type
 - changed the TODO comment to reflect the above change.

version 2: released 10/14
 - added from_numerator to FieldOfFractions interface
 - added nums.cma to Makefile

 - added a specification to Field.inv making the behavior explicitly undefined
   for division by zero
 - added a specification to FieldOfFractions.inv making it raise an exception
   for division by zero.

version 1: released 10/6
 - initial revision
 - region.ml is unimplemented; we will release an implementation soon.

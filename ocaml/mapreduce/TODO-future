Here are things we should change for next semester that would break things this
semester.

 - change Marshalable to Message, change Marshallable.t to message
 - think about protocol that allows concurrency within workers
 - explicitly tell them to implement do_map in the controller.
 - make sure the apps have a function that we can call for testing!


Other ideas for a future run:

 - a "batching" app-functor; a thin wrapper around the app that batches n
   requests together.

4 point rubric -
  4 = perfect        (A range)
  3 = minor mistakes (B range)
  2 = major mistakes (C range)
  1 = massive confusion
  0 = blank

2 point rubric -
  2 = correct or close
  1 = effort
  0 = blank

5a: logic
---------

1 (a) - (d) proof trees
  4 points each

  minor mistakes: things like using an admissable rule without making note,
    substitution mistakes (even if they trickle through), manipulating
    assumptions in a reasonable but informal way
  major mistakes: unclear leaps, assumptions from nowhere, false subgoals
  massive confusion: things like P ⊢ Q ⊢ R or a branch covering multiple
    premises

2 (a) partial correctness
  (b) termination
  4 points total

3 (a) - (c) labeling proofs

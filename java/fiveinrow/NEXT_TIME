 - Testing is a bit hard; API tweaks that would make it easier:
     - Controller.nextMove(Game) -> nextMove(Board)
     - Game constructor that takes a Board

 - Students keep trying to make a HumanController which is a bad idea

 - MinMax specification is a bit murky

 - MinMax has too many players floating around.  Perhaps not make it implement
   controller.

 - Consider giving them TreeAI
